# easy-mp3-downloader
Download latest mp3 songs directly to your local drive without opening a browser.

This was one of my first python projects after I started learning Python. Being a music fan, I used to search the internet for long to find and download latest songs. So, I thought of saving time that I used waste in search of new songs with the help of this Python script.

This python script has a small menu on which you need to input the songs you want to download(English, Hindi or Punjabi). Once you provide an input for the language, it will list down the latest songs of the week/month and start downloading them one by one without your interference. If there was any song that you had already downloaded earlier, it will be skipped.

<b>easy-mp3-downloader.py</b> is coded with Python 2.7 and uses the below Python libraries:
1. 	bs4 (Beautiful Soup 4)
2. requests
3. urllib

To run this script, use below:
